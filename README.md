Project Brief

Requirements

An Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System which will subsequently be built through a * CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.
Webhooks should be used for Jenkins to automatically recreate and redeploy micro services when changes made to the code base
Service-oriented architecture rather than monolithic design
Containerisation and orchestration for micro services deployment
 Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that your application needs to run.
